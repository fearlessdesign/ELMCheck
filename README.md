# ELMCheck

Check the authenticity of your OBD-II scanner with ELMCheck.

Most OBD-II scanners on the market use some variation of ELM327, but did you know that many scanners use clones of the original ELM327? It can be hard to tell, because these clones will work well enough for basic use but fail in unexpected scenarios. This is where ELMCheck comes in.

ELMCheck offers a comprehensive set of test cases that cover the entire documented set of ELM327 commands. Regardless of which version your scanner says it is, ELMCheck can provide a comprehensive report of the features that are actually supported.

Get the confidence you need to use your OBD-II scanner on your vehicle safely.

ELMCheck is free to run basic tests. An in-app purchase will unlock the full test suite.
